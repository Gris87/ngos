1.3. Logging principles                                                                                                                                                                                  // Colorize: green
-----------------------                                                                                                                                                                                  // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
Logging in NGOS generally implemented via default serial port 0x03F8 (ttyS0).<br/>                                                                                                                       // Colorize: green
So, in order to obtain logs from the machine we just need to connect to ttyS0 serial port.                                                                                                               // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
In most cases UEFI::print() calls printing to this serial port inside, but after calling UEFI::exitBootServices() there is no more such possibility.                                                     // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
That's why we have our own mechanism for printing characters to default serial port. You may check it in [src/os/shared/common/src/bits64/serial/serial.cpp](../../../src/os/shared/common/src/bits64/serial/serial.cpp) file.<br/> // Colorize: green
The only thing that we should to do is to call Serial::initConsole() method at the very beginning of the kernel.                                                                                         // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
You may use Serial::print methods for your own debugging, but it is more preferable to use special macros defined in [src/os/shared/common/src/bits64/log/log.h](../../../src/os/shared/common/src/bits64/log/log.h) file.<br/> // Colorize: green
If you check [src/os/shared/common/src/bits64/log/log.h](../../../src/os/shared/common/src/bits64/log/log.h) file you may found that there are several macros like:                                      // Colorize: green
* COMMON_LF                                                                                                                                                                                              // Colorize: green

* COMMON_LE                                                                                                                                                                                              // Colorize: green
* COMMON_LW                                                                                                                                                                                              // Colorize: green
* COMMON_LI                                                                                                                                                                                              // Colorize: green
* COMMON_LD                                                                                                                                                                                              // Colorize: green
* COMMON_LV                                                                                                                                                                                              // Colorize: green
* COMMON_LVV                                                                                                                                                                                             // Colorize: green
* COMMON_LVVV                                                                                                                                                                                            // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
These macros just simply printing its log level and the message with attributes.<br/>                                                                                                                    // Colorize: green
It is better to use macros because they can be simply disabled via [NGOS_BUILD_LOG_LEVEL](../../0.%20Intro/3.%20Configuration/README.md#-----------ngos_build_log_level-----------) configuration parameter. // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
In configuration file you can also see that there are several categories of logging levels.<br/>                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
You may customize each logging level if you want or just inherit it from the general logging level.                                                                                                      // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
Each category has its own macros for logging.                                                                                                                                                            // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
### Assertions                                                                                                                                                                                           // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
Another helpful thing that you may found in NGOS source code is an assertions.                                                                                                                           // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
Please check [src/os/shared/common/src/bits64/log/assert.h](../../../src/os/shared/common/src/bits64/log/assert.h) file.                                                                                 // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
There are 3 kind of asserts implemented:                                                                                                                                                                 // Colorize: green
* ASSERT                                                                                                                                                                                                 // Colorize: green
* TEST_ASSERT                                                                                                                                                                                            // Colorize: green
* ASSERT_EXECUTION                                                                                                                                                                                       // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
ASSERT is mostly used for checking function input parameters and for checking that some stuff working in expected way.<br/>                                                                              // Colorize: green
But TEST_ASSERT is used only for validating values of variables like a inline testing in the source code.                                                                                                // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
ASSERT is available in Debug mode only.<br/>                                                                                                                                                             // Colorize: green
TEST_ASSERT is available in Debug mode with the tests only.                                                                                                                                              // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
Both ASSERT and TEST_ASSERT exits from the current function in case of failure instead of throwing exception because we don't have exception handling yet.                                               // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
ASSERT_EXECUTION macro equivalent to:                                                                                                                                                                    // Colorize: green

ASSERT_EXECUTION is available in Debug mode with the tests only. It will simply call command() in another mode.                                                                                          // Colorize: green
