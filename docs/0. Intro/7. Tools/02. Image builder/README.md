Boot part is actually a PE header that let UEFI to run the image.<br/>                                                                                                                                   // Colorize: green
We can put some attributes in PE header during the build procedure, but the remaining attributes should be filled at the end.<br/>                                                                       // Colorize: green

                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
In order to obtain kernel image you should run image_builder tool with the attributes provided above.<br/>                                                                                               // Colorize: green
Image builder will check the specified ELF files and will create kernel image in PATH_TO_RESULT_IMAGE.                                                                                                   // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
Image builder will also modify PE header attributes of the result file according to the provided input.<br/>                                                                                             // Colorize: green
We are expecting that the result file consist of 3 sections.                                                                                                                                             // Colorize: green

.reloc section is required for UEFI in order to run this image. It is located at 0x0200 offset right after the Boot part and contains 0x40 bytes.                                                        // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
Since UEFI binaries are executed in physical mode, UEFI cannot guarantee that a given binary can be loaded at its preferred address. UEFI does _try_ to load a binary at it's preferred address, but if it can't do so, it will load it at another address and then relocate the binary using the contents of the .reloc section. // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
.config section is located at 0x0240 (0x0200 + 0x40) offset, next to .reloc section. This section contains the code from configure.elf file. It is a entry point for NGOS kernel.                        // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green
.kernel section is located after the .config section and contains raw or compressed kernel.elf file or installer.elf file. This section starts with [KernelDescriptor](../../../../src/os/configure/src/bits64/other/kerneldescriptor.h) that indicates the size of included image. // Colorize: green
                                                                                                                                                                                                         // Colorize: green

It is also possible to provide path to some text.elf file. In this case, Image builder will replace .config section and .kernel section with .text section that contain data from text.elf file.         // Colorize: green
